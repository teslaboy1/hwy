                <p>Class F stator is wrapped with class F epoxy mica tape and mould pressed. Class H stator coil is operated with the mature class H insulation technology and impregnated in VPI (vacuum pressure impregnating) system. Both class F and class H stator coil are processed with anti-corona treatment.</p>
                <p> Meantime, the stator coil is designed with skewed slot structure to effectively reduce harmonic wave. Enhance the mechanical strength on the end of stator winding to effectively prevent and withstand the deformation on the end of stator caused by the sudden load or short circuit.</p>
